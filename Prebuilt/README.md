On the Mac, put the *.component* file in *~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components*, and note with recent versions of macOS *you must log out and back in again* before the plug-in will be visible to Logic Pro X and other Audio-Unit hosts.

On the Mac, put the *.vst* file in *~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST*.

On Windows, put the *.dll* file wherever your VST host program looks for plug-ins.
